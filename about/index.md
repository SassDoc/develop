There is nothing new with SassDoc. It has nothing of a revolutionnary idea; there are countless of SassDoc projects on GitHub, yet most of them are dead or practically unusable.

Still, we needed this. We needed a way to document our Sass files, APIs, frameworks, libraries and whatever. Thus, this project.

SassDoc is built by [Pascal Duez](https://twitter.com/pascalduez), [Valerian Galliat](https://twitter.com/valeriangalliat), [Hugo Giraudel](https://twitter.com/hugogiraudel) and [Fabrice Weinberg](https://twitter.com/fweinb), a.k.a [SassDoc team](https://github.com/sassdoc). And perhaps you, if you feel like contributing!
