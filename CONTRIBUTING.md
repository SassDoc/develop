# Contributing to SassDoc's site

## Fixing a typo

Fork the project, fix the typo and submit a [pull request](https://github.com/SassDoc/sassdoc.github.io/pulls).

## Fixing an incorrect information

Open an issue explaining the problem and possibly how you think it should be fixed.

## Adding a site to "Built with SassDoc" page

Fork the project and add your site to [`_data/built_with_sassdoc.yml`](_data/built_with_sassdoc.yml) then submit a [pull request](https://github.com/SassDoc/sassdoc.github.io/pulls).

If you feel like a true hero, run `make bws` before, however note that you'll have to install webshot-cli. If you cannot or don't want to run this, ask a maintainer to do it in your [pull request](https://github.com/SassDoc/sassdoc.github.io/pulls).
